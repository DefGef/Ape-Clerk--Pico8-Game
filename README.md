# Ape-Clerk--Pico8-Game
This is a project I completed as part of a 10 day game jam in May 2020. The theme of the jam was to develop a game based on a randomnly generated name. My name was "Ape Clerk" and I chose to use the Pico8 console to program the game. This console uses the Lua language.

A playable version of the game is avaiable at https://defgefx.itch.io/ape-clerk. I documented the journey as I went on my twitter account https://twitter.com/GeoffSejai.

For this repository I have included the latest version of the code which I've called v1.2 and was updated after the original submission. The changes were mainly small changes and some bug fixes. I summarised the changes in a dev.log on itch:

"I finally got around to uploading a version 1.2. No major changes, but to summarise here goes:

- New smoother main sprite animation (including the ukulele)

- New music (no so annoying now)

- Winning screen and updated title screen

- Collision detection bug fixes"

For interest I've included the code as it was at the time I submitted it; this is in the branch original-game-code.
